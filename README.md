# The Jira Cloud platform REST API - MicroProfile Rest Client

Jira Cloud platform REST API documentation

## Overview
This API client was initially generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project.

This repository contains a MicroProfile Rest Client for Jira's v3 API as given by the Swagger docs available on their
public website. It has been modified from the generated code to work with Jackson and the types enhanced somewhat
(currently only the "issues" API has undergone any real work). The docs are as-is from the openapi generator.
