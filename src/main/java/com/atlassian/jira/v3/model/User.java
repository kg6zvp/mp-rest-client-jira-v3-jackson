 * A user with details as permitted by the user's Atlassian Account privacy settings. However, be aware of these exceptions:   *  User record deleted from Atlassian: This occurs as the result of a right to be forgotten request. In this case, `displayName` provides an indication and other parameters have default values or are blank (for example, email is blank).  *  User record corrupted: This occurs as a results of events such as a server import and can only happen to deleted users. In this case, `accountId` returns *unknown* and all other parameters have fallback values.  *  User record unavailable: This usually occurs due to an internal service outage. In this case, all parameters have fallback values.
